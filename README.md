### Cloud & Security Engineer (In Progress) | HomeLab Builder | Automation-Focused

I’m a **security-minded technologist** transitioning into **cloud security and infrastructure engineering**.  
My focus is on **secure system design**, **cloud architecture**, and **operational security**, backed by hands-on labs and real-world projects.

I’m intentionally building toward roles like **SOC Analyst**, **Cloud Security Analyst**, and **Cloud Security Engineer (Junior)**.

## 🧭 Current Focus
- 🛡️ Studying **Security+** with a cloud-first security mindset  
- ☁️ Building and securing infrastructure in **AWS** (VPC, IAM, logging, monitoring)  
- 📊 Learning **SIEM & log analysis** (Splunk, CloudTrail-style workflows)  
- 🧪 Expanding my **HomeLab** for security testing, networking, and automation  
- 📚 Documenting projects clearly and reproducibly

## 🧠 Technical Interests
- Cloud security & IAM  
- Secure network architecture  
- Detection engineering fundamentals  
- Infrastructure as Code (early-stage)  
- Linux systems & automation  
- Incident response workflows

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

### Cloud & Infrastructure
- AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC – in progress)
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Networking fundamentals (routing, firewalling, segmentation)

### Security
- SIEM concepts (Splunk – in progress)
- Logging & monitoring
- IAM / least-privilege design
- Threat & incident fundamentals

### Development & Automation
- Python (automation-focused learning)

## 🧪 Projects & Labs
I prioritize **hands-on learning** over theory. Repositories here reflect:
- Cloud security labs
- Network segmentation & firewall testing
- Log ingestion and analysis
- Automation experiments
- Certification-aligned study notes

Each repository includes documentation explaining **why** decisions were made, not just *what* was built.

## 🎯 2025–2026 Goals
- Earn **Security+**, **AWS Solutions Architect – Associate**, and **Splunk Core**
- Transition into a **security or cloud-security role**
- Contribute to open-source projects related to cloud or security tooling
- Continue building and documenting real systems
